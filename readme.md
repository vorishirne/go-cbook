# eink-web

People choose eink readers like kindle, boox and onyx over ipads and phones, as they try to safeguard their eyes while
doing there book/comics reading.

But are eyes important to only those who read books. I spend double time from them reading on web, what about me?

Hence, here comes the eink-web: which basically is all the support you want for reading webpages as pdf. One can collect
the bookmarks or links to read, and this tool is going to render them as pdfs.

Now pdfs are super awesome format when it comes to eink readers, as traversing between pages is lot easier in that case.

# how to use

provide a file, with all the links that need to be downloaded and converted to pdf.

there are a bunch of css files & other settings that are previously available for different kind of links, for ex:

1. k8 docs
2. istio docs
3. go sites docs
4. medium.com articles
5. github.com/issues
6. github.com/wiki
7. stackoverflow answers

So what we do is, we match the prefix of the url, for which settings are available, and then apply those.

U can add settings for your own site, by following the available settings in mod directory.
